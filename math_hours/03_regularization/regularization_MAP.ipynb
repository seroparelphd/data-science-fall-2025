    "4.  We introduce a loss function $\\ell(\\beta)$ to measure how good a job $f_\\beta$ does on the training data.  $\\ell$ takes $\\beta$ as input and returns a non-negative real number as output.\n",
    "5.  We choose $\\hat{\\beta}$ so that $\\ell(\\hat{\\beta})$ is minimized or, if this is impossible, at least approximate a local minimum. \n",
