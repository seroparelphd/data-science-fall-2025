# ds-boot-camp-prep

This repository has two purposes:

1.  To test that you are able to set up a conda environment and execute code in a Jupyter notebook using that environment.
2.  To give you an self-assessment of your Python fundamentals.  

### Conda environment and running Jupyter notebooks

Follow the instructions here:  https://www.erdosinstitute.org/ds-boot-camp-prep

### Python Prerequisite Self-Assessment

Complete the exercises in `python_prereq_quiz.ipynb` without using anything beyond official documentation.  Check your answers against `python_prereq_solutions.ipynb`.  Please resist the temptation to peak at the solutions before trying the quiz yourself!  If you find this quiz difficult we recommend that you take our [Python Prep Course](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/programs/asynchronous/python-prep).
